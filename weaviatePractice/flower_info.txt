Euphorbia polycarpa	Smallseed sandmat	['Arizona', 'California']	Euphorbia polycarpa is a highly variable species distributed throughout the Baja California peninsula, eastern Sonora, and the arid southwestern United States from southwestern Arizona to southern Nevada and central California. L. C. Wheeler (1941) divided the species into seven varieties, the majority of which occur in Baja California Sur. He reported two of these for the United States: var. hirtella and var. polycarpa. Variety hirtella, as the name suggests, was applied to hairy plants. However, it is here treated as a synonym of var. polycarpa, because variation in pubescence shows no geographic segregation and ranges along a continuum from glabrous or sparsely to densely hairy, and because glabrous and hairy branches can occur on the same individual.	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e8/Euphorbiapolycarpa.jpg/220px-Euphorbiapolycarpa.jpg
